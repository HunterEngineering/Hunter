          <p> Solution Hunter Engineering itself uses Hunter for leading edge research. Some
            of the results will appear as new features in Hunter.
          </p>
          <p> NOTE: The industries that use Hunter are controlled and often monitored by places like the
          the US FDA.  These certiciations are rigourous taking a long time to complete.</p>
          <p> For this reason, Hunter has both frequent as well as long-term releases available.</p>
          <p> Major releases provide support contracts (see Contracts), while Minor releases rely mostly on blogs.</p>
          <p> Hunter can be licensed in a number of forms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The initial installation of a release purchased for internal use is supported and later 
              can be supported by a license (see Contracts). </li>
            <li> Hunter can be used on an as-needed basis on available cloud platforms.
            </li>
            <li>Adaptive pre-releasing - the "back-end of the Genetics Hunter" is sensitive to the industry
            and subject of the research and thus, can require some customization where Solution
            Hunter Engineering works with the client company to build the backend "evaluators" (or adapt ones that Hunter
            may already have.)
