            <p>Hunter Searches solves problems so vast that normal computer search methods can’t find
              an solution in a reasonable time - or maybe ever.</p>
            <p>
              For example:
            <ul>
              <li> Medical: A better material replacement for knee cartiledge, Material
                Science (Physics), BioChemical, BioMedical, and others. Computers might try to assemble molecules or organic components 
                for a biologically safe material having characteristics for elasticity, hardness, etc.</li>
              <li> Other BioMedical areas such as Stem Cell Research, Cancer, or Viruses. </li>
              <li> Many problems are multi-part: first find a physical solution, and
                then determining how to manufacture it.  
                Hunter's "State-Machine Techniques" allow this.
              </li>
              <li> Other areas from the common cold, flu, HIV, heart disease,  
                Parkinson's, and degenerative aging.
              </li>
              <li> Long-term Weather prediction. A lot of work has gone into improving weather
                prediction over the years; it still has room for improvement.
              </li>
              <li> Improving crop production.</li>
              <li> Creating educational applications that adapt to the abilities and 
                characteristics of the student.
              </li>
            </ul>
